Repository contains code and mask collection for mapping open- and closed-loop motor networks at rest with ultra-high field, multi-echo EPI data. This resource was used to generate results for: Rizor et al., 2024, Dissociation of putative open loop circuit from ventral putamen to motor cortical areas in humans I: high-resolution connectomics. For information on how to process data using this code, please refer to script_pipeline.txt

# Why study "open" and "closed" loop motor circuits? 
In non-human primates, separable "open-loop" and "closed-loop" motor circuits have been identified via rabies virus tracing (Kelly & Strick, 2004). In Parkinson's Disease (PD), the closed-loop is compromised via degredation of the dorsal putamen connectivity. Preserved open-loop circuitry in the human brain may explain paradoxical kinesia, or the phenomenon where PD patients display enhanced movement in emotionally arousing situations. If identified in humans, the open-loop circuit may be a potential target for PD therapy.
