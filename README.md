# Why study "open" and "closed" loop motor circuits? 
In non-human primates, separable "open-loop" and "closed-loop" motor circuits have been identified via rabies virus tracing. In Parkinson's Disease (PD), the closed-loop is compromised via degredation of the dorsal putamen connectivity. Preserved open-loop circuitry in the human brain may explain paradoxical kinesia, or the phenomenon where PD patients display enhanced movement in emotionally arousing situations. If identified, the open-loop circuit may be a potential target for PD therapy.
