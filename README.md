Collection of human brain masks for posited open-loop and closed-loop motor circuit nodes in 2mm MNI space. Mask descriptions found in where_masks_come_from.txt. Can be used with included code to identify resting-state seed-to-voxel connectivity.

In non-human primates, separable "open-loop" and "closed-loop" motor circuits have been identified via rabies virus tracing. In Parkinson's Disease, the closed-loop is compromised via degredation of the dorsal putamen. Preserved open-loop circuitry in the human brain may explain paradoxical kinesia, or the phenomenon where PD patients display enhanced movement in fight-or-flight (emotion-driven) situations.
