preprocess
1. preprocess_multi_echo_part1.sh with or without fmap for bad fmap subs (use bet_fsl.sh for to get mag brain if ANTs/default BET isn't good)
2. get_slicetime_files.py to get custom slicetime correction files 
2. preprocess_multi_echo_part2.sh with or without fmap (use bet_fsl.sh for to get SBRef brain if ANTs/default BET isn't good)
3. tedana_script.py for Tedana denoising 
4. Prepare physio regressor files: with physIO toolbox in MATLAB, create and run physio jobs scripts for cardiac and respiratory files
5. Run denoised EPI files through regress_physio_and_smooth.sh 

get FC maps
1. binarize masks transformed to participant native space with binarize_masks.sh
2. run make_resting_maps_loop.m with fisherZcorr.m to get fisher's Z maps 

figs/tables
figs 3 and 5
1. transform fishzmaps to mni space with fishzmaps_to_mni.sh
2. get average seed-to-voxel FC maps across subs with get_avg_fishZmaps.sh

figs 2 and 4 + stats
1. get nativespace ROI-pair FC values with get_regional_connectivity.sh
2. run anovas, t-tests, and plot fig 2 with preprint_stats_figs.py
